# C_Interstellar_Game
This is my first coding project. and it is a game. I started to learn coding with programming language C.

{
		printf("		THIS GAME IS MADE BY	O S M A N   C A N   C I N A R   \n");
		
	}

	void arrows()
	{
		printf("\n	||			||			||			|| 			|| \n");
		printf("	||			||			||			|| 			|| \n");
		printf("	||			||			||			|| 			|| \n");
		printf("	\\/			\\/			\\/			\\/			\\/  \n\n\n");
	}

	void menu(int fuel, float current_year)
	{
		printf("	 ! ! ! ! P L E A S E   P L A Y   T H I S   G A M E   O N   F U L L   S C R E E N ! ! ! !\n\n\n");

		printf("	If you find a planet that is habitable and have enough fuel in the tank to go back to earth than you could be the chosen one!!! \n\n");
		printf("	Currently you're at planet Earth and you have %d light years of fuel and year is %0.lf.\n",fuel, current_year);
		printf("	Hope you come back before all your loved ones die. Good luck on your Journey!!! \n\n");
		printf("	The Journey Begins...\n\n");
		printf("						E   A   R   T   H						\n"); 
		printf("					 	  2   0   2   0					\n\n");
